SECURITY ALERT:
===============

Someone accessed our Sleigh Dashboard API last night and left an encoded message.
Whoever did this wanted us to find it - they're leaving a trail.

I've been decoding the message... it references this file. They left something here.

Below is a message I found embedded in a hidden comment in our dashboard logs:

MERRY'S NOTES:
==============

This message is encoded with ROT13 - a simple substitution cipher.
Each letter is shifted 13 positions in the alphabet (A→N, B→O, etc.)

I need to decode this to see what Jack Frost is really saying!

The flag is in there somewhere... once I decode it, I can prove we've uncovered
the first part of this attack.

---

TO DO:
- Decode the ROT13 message above
- Extract the flag
- Report findings to Dekker Frostbeard (SOC Manager)
- Investigate how they got access to our dashboard API
- Check for other compromised systems

Time to dig deeper. Christmas depends on us! 🎄
